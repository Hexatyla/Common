# Common


Hexatyla's containers common to client and server

## Note

This is the stable version used by both [Hexatyla/Client](https://github.com/Hexatyla/Client) and [Hexatyla/Server](https://github.com/Hexatyla/Server).

## TODO

- Proper abstraction
- Find a way to make it compile with the Client and the Server without using hacks.
